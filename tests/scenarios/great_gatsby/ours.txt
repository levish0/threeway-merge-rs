In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've carried with me ever since.

"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one," he told me, "just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had."

He didn't say any more, but we've always been unusually communicative in a reserved way, and I understood that he meant a great deal more than that. In consequence, I'm inclined to reserve all judgments, a habit that has opened up many curious natures to me and also made me the victim of not a few veteran bores.

The abnormal mind is quick to detect and attach itself to this quality when it appears in a normal person, and so it came about that in college I was unjustly accused of being a politician, because I was privy to the secret griefs of wild, unknown men.

Most of the big shore dinners I attended at New Haven were pitched in a minor key, those were the nights when the wind blew strong across the Sound from the Long Island shore.

I suppose there's something romantic about those college years, when everything seemed possible and the future stretched out before us like an uncharted sea.
