## üåü Overview

`threeway-merge-rs` is a Rust library for **string-based 3-way merging** using Git's proven merge algorithms.  
It uses **libgit2/xdiff** via safe FFI bindings, providing the same merge behavior as `git merge-file` but with a pure string API perfect for applications that need to merge text content programmatically.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **String-based API**: Works with `&str` inputs, no file I/O required
- **Git-compatible**: Produces identical results to `git merge-file`  
- **Memory safe**: Safe Rust wrapper around battle-tested C library
- **Conflict detection**: Automatic conflict counting and detailed output
- **Zero runtime dependencies**: C library compiled at build time

### Configurable Merge Options

#### Diff Algorithm
- `Myers` ‚Äì Default, standard diff
- `Minimal` ‚Äì Minimal changes
- `Patience` ‚Äì Patience diff algorithm
- `Histogram` ‚Äì Histogram-based diff

#### Merge Level
- `Minimal` ‚Äì Conservative merging
- `Eager` ‚Äì Slightly more aggressive
- `Zealous` ‚Äì Aggressive merge
- `ZealousAlnum` ‚Äì Aggressive with alphanumeric heuristics

#### Merge Favor
- `None` ‚Äì No automatic favor
- `Ours` ‚Äì Prefer "ours" changes
- `Theirs` ‚Äì Prefer "theirs" changes
- `Union` ‚Äì Combine changes when possible

#### Merge Style
- `Normal` ‚Äì Default 3-way merge
- `Diff3` ‚Äì Include base lines in conflicts
- `ZealousDiff3` ‚Äì Diff3 style with aggressive merging

#### Conflict Markers
- Customize marker labels and sizes (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

Add to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
threeway-merge = "0.1.0"
```

### Basic Usage

```rust
use threeway_merge_rs::{merge_strings, MergeOptions};

fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let base = "Hello world\nSecond line";
    let ours = "Hello Rust world\nSecond line"; 
    let theirs = "Hello beautiful world\nSecond line";

    let result = merge_strings(base, ours, theirs, &MergeOptions::default())?;
    
    println!("Conflicts: {}", result.conflicts);
    println!("Result:\n{}", result.content);
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### Advanced Configuration

```rust
use threeway_merge_rs::{
    merge_strings, MergeOptions, DiffAlgorithm, MergeStyle, MergeFavor
};

let mut options = MergeOptions::default();
options.algorithm = DiffAlgorithm::Histogram;
options.style = MergeStyle::ZealousDiff3;
options.favor = Some(MergeFavor::Ours);
options.base_label = Some("original".to_string());
options.ours_label = Some("mine".to_string());
options.theirs_label = Some("theirs".to_string());
options.marker_size = 10;

let result = merge_strings(base, ours, theirs, &options)?;
```

### Git Equivalent

This Rust code:
```rust
let result = merge_strings(base, ours, theirs, &options)?;
```

Is equivalent to:
```bash
git merge-file --diff-algorithm histogram --zdiff3 \
  -L "mine" ours.txt -L "original" base.txt -L "theirs" theirs.txt --stdout
```
